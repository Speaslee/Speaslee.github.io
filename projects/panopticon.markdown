logline: After dying in an escape attempt a prisoner wakes up in the infirmary realizing he's serving much more than just a life sentence.
synopsis: Spencer is serving a five-year prison sentence for a crime he didnʼt commit. The injustice of his situation and his desire to see his wife and young child again drives Spencer to repeatedly try to break out despite the severe punishments he faces when he fails.<br> While other prisoners mostly avoid Spencer, a small group, hoping to utilize his experience in their own escape attempt, seek him out. A mistake during their plan leads to catastrophe and Spencer’s companions are picked off one by one. While attempting to surrender, Spencer is also killed.<br>Waking up in his cell with clear memories of dying, Spencer searches for answers. He discovers he is actually an anti-escape training tool for prisons, and all his memories of his family were constructed from a mother and daughter Spencer killed in his original life during an escape attempt twenty years ago.
